1. External libraries

This application uses some third-party software libraries. I'd like to thank
the authors of these excellent packages for making them freely available!

 - zlib (1.2.3)

 - LZMA SDK (4.58 beta)

2. Version notes

Version 0.2:
- All three compression types are now supported!

- Extracting files no longer removes them from the archive, as this feature
  was necessary only when some files could not be extracted.
  Simply extract all files and rename/remove the original archive to use the
  extracted (possibbly modified) files.

Version 0.1:
- Extracting files REMOVES THEM FROM THE ARCHIVE!
  Therefore, before you do anything, make a copy of your common.hha and
  parpg.hha files. (Alternatively you can restore these files by reinstalling.)

- Only extracting files stored with compression type 0 or 1 is supported.

- File names are case insenstive in the archive, but case senstive
  in the Linux filesystem! The game does not refer to files using the same
  capitalization that is used in the archive, so on Linux files may need to
  be renamed after extracting them, or the game cannot find them and crashes.
 
  To detect when this happens, try running the game as follows:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=linux_libs/
    strace ./RainSlickEp1_bin | grep open | grep parpg/data
  And look for misspelled filenames.
