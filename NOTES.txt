0.1:
- Note that extracting files REMOVES THEM FROM THE ARCHIVE!
  Therefore, before you do anything, make a copy of your common.hha and
  parpg.hha files. (Alternatively you can restore these files by reinstalling.)

- Only extracting files stored with compression type 0 or 1 is supported.

- Note that file names are case insenstive in the archive, but case senstive
  in the Linux filesystem! The game does not refer to files using the same
  capitalization that is used in the archive, so on Linux files may need to
  be renamed after extracting them, or the game cannot find them and crashes.
 
  To detect when this happens, try running the game as follows:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=linux_libs/
    strace ./RainSlickEp1_bin | grep open | grep parpg/data
  And look for misspelled filenames.
